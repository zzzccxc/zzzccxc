Hi, call me klopi.

I actually know :

- Basic network administration (LAN/WAN, VLAN, DHCP, DNS, VPN)
- Cisco configuration (switches, routers, CLI basics)
- Linux and Windows Server management
- Network monitoring (Zabbix, PRTG, Wireshark)
- Bash, PowerShell
- IT security fundamentals (firewalls, updates, VPN)

*I'm currently learning and improving my skills in network administration, system management, and IT security.*

I also do a bit of coding but just the essential : CSS HTML JS and Python
