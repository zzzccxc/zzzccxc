Hello,
I’m a tech enthusiast.
I’m a beginner in system administration with a solid background in networking.
I have experience configuring Cisco devices (switches, routers, basic CLI).
I can manage both Linux and Windows servers.
I’m familiar with network monitoring tools (Zabbix, PRTG, Wireshark).
I know Bash and PowerShell scripting, and I have a good understanding of IT security fundamentals (firewalls, updates, VPNs).

I’m currently learning and improving my skills.

I also do a bit of coding, focusing on the essentials: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
I’m also familiar with YAML, JSON, and SQL for automation and configuration tasks

You can talk to me in : French (native) English (C1) and korean (A1)
